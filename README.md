# Pre-work - *Repeat After Me, Please!*

**Repeat After Me, Please!** is a Light & Sound Memory game to apply for CodePath's SITE Program. 

Submitted by: **Danny Lau**

Time spent: **10** hours spent in total

Link to project: (insert your link here, should start with https://glitch.com...)

## Required Functionality

The following **required** functionality is complete:

* [x] Game interface has a heading (h1 tag), a line of body text (p tag), and four buttons that match the demo app
* [x] "Start" button toggles between "Start" and "Stop" when clicked. 
* [x] Game buttons each light up and play a sound when clicked. 
* [x] Computer plays back sequence of clues including sound and visual cue for each button
* [x] Play progresses to the next turn (the user gets the next step in the pattern) after a correct guess. 
* [x] User wins the game after guessing a complete pattern
* [x] User loses the game after an incorrect guess

The following **optional** features are implemented:

* [x] Any HTML page elements (including game buttons) has been styled differently than in the tutorial
* [x] Buttons use a pitch (frequency) other than the ones in the tutorial
* [x] More than 4 functional game buttons
* [ ] Playback speeds up on each turn
* [ ] Computer picks a different pattern each time the game is played
* [ ] Player only loses after 3 mistakes (instead of on the first mistake)
* [ ] Game button appearance change goes beyond color (e.g. add an image)
* [ ] Game button sound is more complex than a single tone (e.g. an audio file, a chord, a sequence of multiple tones)
* [ ] User has a limited amount of time to enter their guess on each turn

The following **additional** features are implemented:

- [ ] List anything else that you can get done to improve the app!

2. What was a challenge you encountered in creating this submission (be specific)? How did you overcome it? (recommended 200 - 400 words) 

Having only worked with Python and Pycharm in my programming classes, I was completely new to the languages used in this assignment as well as Glitch. I am at point where I am getting more comfortable writing and even just looking at code on a screen. Tackling this project was eye opening and unique because it exposed to me this entire new arena of computer engineering that I have yet to tackle in my school curriculum. I got my first error in this project when I implemented a function, ran the program, and an error stating, “Parsing error: Unexpected token.” This was the first time I have seen a new type of error pop up before. It never occurred to me that each language would have its own type of errors. I looked up the error, “Parsing error: Unexpected token,” and read online that it is a syntax error. I looked through my code and saw that I had an extra “}” and deleted it. After that, the program ran correctly. 

When I read about people who begin to learn programming, they often ask with which languages are best to start learning, and more experienced programmers reply that learning a specific language over another is not as important as learning the fundamentals within programming. I never really understood that until this assignment. I do not know the syntax nor rules within the languages employed in this program, but what I learned in my introduction to programming class are some of the fundamental basics. I knew enough to be comfortable working in this assignment despite never having used any of these languages. When I hit a roadblock with the syntax error, I was able to find information online the resource pointed me in the right direction. This is when the idea that learning fundamental concepts is more important than deciding through which language to learn programming. 


3. What questions about web development do you have after completing your submission? (recommended 100 - 300 words) 

Building my own website is something that I have always wanted to do, but using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript to make this webpage is something I have never done before. It was fascinating to see the project coming alive in the preview as I typed in code. This was a remarkable experience because I have only done coding projects in Pycharm to complete assignments and was wondering how coding fits into building something like a webpage. In terms of big picture, I am curious if building a webpage requires this three-pronged approach of utilizing HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, and if these languages were invented for the purpose of making a website. Are there other ways to build a webpage that just use one language so that you don’t have to make sure these three different languages “speak” to each other and connect? I have heard of applications that anyone can use to build a website that do not require a person knowing how to program. Is there a benefit of programming versus using an application? Is the purpose of building a website using code for the sake of coding and practicing to code? 

4. If you had a few more hours to work on this project, what would you spend them doing (for example: refactoring certain functions, adding additional features, etc). Be specific. (recommended 100 - 300 words) 

I think it would be cool to have a version of the game that goes on forever until a person makes a mistake. There can also be a feature that keeps track of how far you go into the game for record keeping. If this webpage is a public site, then the top ten scores of any users could be listed on the side.

There can also be a version that can put two players against each other on separate computers online. The first player starts by pressing one button to set the pattern and the second player must repeat the pattern. Then the second player sets the pattern by hitting the same or different button and the first player must repeat the whole pattern up until that point. The players keep alternating between repeating and setting the pattern until one player makes a mistake and the other player wins. In this two-player version, players can also select with how many buttons they want to play and how many times they want to press the buttons each turn to set the pattern. For example, players can play with 3 button presses per turn.
